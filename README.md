Data Analytics Portfolio

Introduction

Hello! I'm Sebastián Chacón, a physics graduate with a passion for data analytics. During my undergraduate studies, I delved into programming, primarily focusing on Python, with additional experience in Matlab and Fortran. To further enhance my data analytics skills, I completed a Professional Certificate from DataCamp, where I extensively used libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This portfolio serves as a showcase of my abilities and projects, with the goal of demonstrating my potential to future employers in the data analytics field.

Projects

1. Android Apps Dataset Analysis

Overview:
This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about various Android apps. I did exploratory analysis on the data set as well as analysis between the apps categories, prices and ratings utilizing Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Highlights:
- The finding I feel most interested about is that users tend to leave less harsh reviews on paid apps compared to free ones.

2. Movie Data Exploration

Overview:
In this project, I examined a dataset related to movies, aiming to answer the question: Are movies getting shorter? Leveraging my data analytics skills, I performed exploratory data analysis and visualization to extract valuable information from the dataset.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Highlights:
- The most important conclusion from the analysis is that movies arent getting shorter.  

3. Impact of Handwashing on Medicine

Overview:
This project delves into the historical significance of the discovery of handwashing's importance in medicine. I analyzed data made by the Dr.Ignaz Semmelweis in the 19th Century to showcase the impact of this discovery on medical outcomes, providing a narrative using data analytics techniques.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Highlights:
- Handwashinh introduction reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval. All in all, it would seem that Semmelweis had solid evidence that handwashing was a simple but highly effective procedure that could save many lives.
  
Code

The code for each project is organized in separate directories within this repository. Feel free to explore the code, documentation, and comments to understand the methodologies and approaches used in each project.

Future Work

While these projects represent my current skill set, I am committed to continuous improvement. In the future, I plan to expand this portfolio with more projects, incorporating new technologies and addressing more complex challenges.
